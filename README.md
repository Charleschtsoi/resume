# Charles Tsoi — Motion Resume

Role-agnostic career portfolio with an interactive homepage and Apple-inspired scroll narrative. Screen-share friendly: presenter mode on `/story`, chapter navigation, curated GitHub showcase, and downloadable PDF.

**Repository:** [github.com/Charleschtsoi/resume](https://github.com/Charleschtsoi/resume)

## Features

- **Homepage hub** (`/`) — Animated hero, value pillars, interactive timeline, strength tabs, work teaser
- **Career story** (`/story`) — Scroll narrative (Cathay → HKJC/Accenture → Apple → AAHK → education → core strengths)
- **Presenter mode** — `/story?present=1` or nav **Present** on Story: shorter sections, full-opacity text, chapter toolbar, arrow-key navigation
- **Work page** — Six curated repos with role relevance lines and 30s talk tracks ([`/work`](http://localhost:3000/work))
- **Showcase page** — Production deployments: live URLs, architecture, clone steps, APIs ([`/showcase`](http://localhost:3000/showcase))
- **Supporting pages** — Experience timeline, skills/certs, contact + PDF

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Charleschtsoi/resume.git
cd resume
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

**Production build:**

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Presenter mode (screen-share)

Best for live walkthroughs with interviewers:

1. Open **http://localhost:3000/story?present=1** (or click **Present** on the Story page).
2. Use bottom chapter pills or **← / →** to jump between sections.
3. Rehearse on a second monitor at **100% zoom** (1080p).

**Interview checklist**

- [ ] Present mode on (`?present=1` or toggle)
- [ ] Fullscreen browser; notifications off
- [ ] Test chapter jumps and arrow keys once
- [ ] Second tabs: **`/work`**, **`/showcase`** (LungLens live URLs), and **`/experience`** (depth Q&A)
- [ ] ~10–12 min story: Hero (30s) → chapters (~2m each) → role fit → close
- [ ] Short on time after AAHK: **`/work`** — LungLens + localLLM only
